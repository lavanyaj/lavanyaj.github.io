description: I am a computer scientist and engineer interested in distributed systems, networking and cloud computing. I am excited about developing large-scale, simple, and practical systems, which are grounded in theory. I finished my Ph.D. at Stanford, where I was advised by [Nick McKeown](http://tiny-tera.stanford.edu/~nickm/).
