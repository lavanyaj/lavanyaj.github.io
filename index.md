I am a _Senior Software Engineer_ at Google. I work on network traffic management for Google's wide-area network (WAN). Specifically, I work in the [Bandwidth Enforcer](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2015/pdf/papers/p1.pdf) team, which computes and enforces bandwidth allocations on Google's WAN to meet various business policies. 

My research interests are in wide-area networking, congestion control, software-defined networks and programmable networks. I am excited about developing large-scale, simple, and practical systems, which are grounded in theory.

Prior to joining Google in 2019, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University üå≤, where I was advised by Professor [Nick McKeown](http://klamath.stanford.edu/~nickm/index.html). During my Ph.D., I explored a class of <i> proactive </i> congestion control algorithms for the Internet and datacenters, where network switches co-ordinate to rapidly figure out how to share bandwidth among different applications.  
Before that, I received my B.S.E. in Computer Science from Princeton University üêÖ, where I discovered computer science research, and I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Jennifer Rexford](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jrex/), [Moses Charikar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/moses-charikar) and [Christiane Fellbaum](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~fellbaum/). At Princeton, I developed techniques to measure Internet traffic at line rate in hardware, and worked to improve [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), a lexical database of English widely used in computational linguistics.
