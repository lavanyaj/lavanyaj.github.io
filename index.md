# Research
During my Ph.D., I focused on a class of _proactive_ congestion control algorithms for the Internet, where network switches 
co-ordinate to rapidly figure out how to share bandwidth among different applications. I have also worked on tools for programming 
reconfigurable switches. Previously, as un undergraduate, I worked on techniques to measure Internet traffic at line rate in hardware.
